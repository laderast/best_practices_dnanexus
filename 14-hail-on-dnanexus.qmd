## What is Hail?

Hail is a genomics framework built on top of Spark to allow for scalable genomics queries. It uses many of the same concepts (partitions, executors, plans) but it is genomics focused. 

For example, the Hail MatrixFrame can be QC'ed, and then filtered on these QC metrics.  

## Keep in Mind

The cardinal rule of MatrixTables is this:

> **Row** operations operate on *variants*, while **column** operations operate on *samples*.

It is easy to get lost in a chain of Hail commands and not be able to understand what the code is doing unless you concentrate on this.
