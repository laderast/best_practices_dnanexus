# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a companion book to [Bash for Bioinformatics](https://laderast.github.io/bash_for_bioinformatics/). 

In this book we attempt to highlight best practices on the DNAnexus platform given some previous knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

After reading this book and doing the exercises, you should be able to:

- **Explain** the object based filesystem on the DNAnexus platform and how it differs from Linux/Unix POSIX filesystems.
- **Explain** key details of the UKB Research Analysis Platform and how these details impact your work.
- **Utilize** Projects and Organizations to effectively manage data for your group.
- **Use** Spark to connect, extract, and manipulate Apollo Datasets on the platform.
- **Utilize** Hail to load, query, model, annotate, and visualize large-scale genomics data such as the Exome Data on the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform.
- **Build** native DNAnexus apps effectively that manage inputs, outputs, and work with batch mode.
- **Utilize** existing and **build** native DNAnexus workflows using Workflow Description Language (WDL).
- **Execute** NextFlow pipelines on the DNAnexus Platform.

Our goal is to bring information together in a task-oriented format to achieve things on the platform.

## Four Levels of Using DNAnexus

One way to approach learning DNAnexus is to think about the skills you need to process a number of files. Ben Busby has noted there are 4 main skill levels in processing files on the DNAnexus platform:

| Level | \# of Files   | Skill                                     |
|-------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1     | 1             | Interactive Analysis (Cloud Workstation, JupyterLab)                                  |
| 2     | 1-50 Files    | `dx run`, Swiss Army Knife                          |
| 3     | 50-1000 Files | Building your own apps                    |
| 4     | 1000+ Files, multiple steps   | Using WDL (Workflow Description Language) |

We'll be covering mostly level 3 and 4 in this book. But you will need to be at level 2 before you can tackle these topics.

The key is to gradually build on your skills. 

## Prerequisites

Before you tackle this book, you should be able to accomplish the following:

- Utilize [Basic Bash Skills for DNAnexus](https://laderast.github.io/bash_for_bioinformatics/)
- Understand the [basic architecture of Cloud Computing](https://laderast.github.io/bash_for_bioinformatics/03-cloud-computing-basics.html)
- Know how to [edit and utilize JSON Files](https://laderast.github.io/bash_for_bioinformatics/06-JSON.html)
- Be familiar with `dx-toolkit` commands, including:
  - [`dx run`](https://laderast.github.io/bash_for_bioinformatics/04-doing-work-with-dx-run.html)
  - [`dx find data`](https://laderast.github.io/bash_for_bioinformatics/05-batch-processing.html#sec-dx-find) and [`dx find jobs`/`dx watch`](https://laderast.github.io/bash_for_bioinformatics/05-batch-processing.html#when-batching-tag-your-jobs)

We recommend reviewing [Bash for Bioinformatics](https://laderast.github.io/bash_for_bioinformatics/) if you need to brush up on these prerequisite skills.

## Want to be a Contributor?

This is the first draft of this book. It's not going to be perfect, and we need help.

If you find a problem/issue or have a question, you can file it as an issue using [this link](https://github.com/laderast/best_practices_dnanexus/issues/new/choose).

In your issue, please note the following:

- Your Name
- What your issue was
- Which section, and line you found problematic or wouldn't run

If you have large edits: If you're quarto/GitHub savvy, you can fork and file a pull request for typos/edits. If you're not, you can file an issue.

Just be aware that this is not my primary job - I'll try to be as responsive as I can.
